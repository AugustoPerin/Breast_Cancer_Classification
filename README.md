# Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the classification of breast cancer using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this project is obtained from the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer database, which includes features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning models to classify tumors as either malignant or benign based on these features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features include various measurements related to the characteristics of cell nuclei. The dataset is available in the `data` folder.
